# Contribution of EVs to Building's Peak Power Consumption

This software supports the estimation of the impact of EV charging on the building's peak power demand. Peak kW and kVA are used by Toronto Hydro to calculate distribution and transmission charges.

## Data sources and intervals of interest

For a given billing period, we can identify the time intervals in which the peak kW and kVA occurred based on metering data downloads from Toronto Hydro.

Given a time interval of interest, this software estimates the peak kW and kVA demand associated with EV charging activity during the interval. The data source for EV power demand is the Evolute monthly session report.

### Interval of interest boundaries

They are constrained as follows:

- The left and right end-points are always of the form HH:00:00 or HH:15:00 or HH:30:00 or HH:45:00.
- The difference between the right end-point and the left end-point can be either:
  - 1 hour -- only if the left end-point is of the form HH:00:00.
  - 15 minutes -- in all four cases.
- The interval is half-open: it includes the left end-point and excludes the right end-point.

## Workflow

This is the typical workflow used with this software to estimate the impact of EV charging activity on a particular Toronto Hydro bill:

- Preliminary steps (out of scope for this software):
  - Download Toronto Hydro metering data for the time period of interest.
  - Based on the downloaded data, identify the interval(s) of interest during which the billing period's peak kW and/or peak kVA occurred.
  - Obtain the *session report* file from Evolute covering the interval(s) of interest.
- Using this software:
  - Transform the relevant Evolute *session report* CSV file to an Excel file. The transformation process includes some data validation and computes additional columns that are included in the Excel file.
  - Access the relevant Excel file and compute the peak kW and kVA brackets for the interval(s) of interest.

## Tools

Two command-line binaries, one per workflow step.

The desktop app, `ev_cost_recovery`, does not cover these two steps. It answers the billing-period question — what EV cost-recovery rates recover against a bill — and reads the session reports as CSV without a workbook in between. See the top-level [README](../../README.md), "The app".

### Command line

| Command                                                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ev_csv_to_xlsx <SESSION_REPORT.csv>...`                     | Converts a session report to a workbook, computing the derived columns and flagging rows that need review. Takes several files at once. |
| `ev_peak_cli <SESSION_REPORT.xlsx> <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [EST\|EDT]> [15m\|1h]` | Prints the peak estimate report for one interval of interest. Needs `--features historic`. |

`ev_peak_cli` takes the interval start in **local time (ET)**. The length defaults to `1h` when the start is on the hour and `15m` otherwise. An interval breaking the boundary rules described earlier is rejected rather than estimated.

The two DST transitions are treated differently, because they are different problems.

- On the night DST **ends**, an hour of wall time occurs twice. That is a question the caller can answer, so `ev_peak_cli` asks it: a bare `"2026-11-01 01:30"` is refused, and `"2026-11-01 01:30 EST"` or `"... EDT"` resolves it. The designator is accepted on any date and **checked against it** — `"2026-06-01 16:00 EST"` is an error, not a silently ignored hint — so naming the wrong one cannot produce a figure for the wrong hour.
- On the night DST **begins**, an hour of wall time never happens. There is nothing to choose between, so such a start is refused outright and no designator helps.

These rules live in one place, `src/session/ioi.rs`, and every caller comes through it, so nothing that asks for an interval can disagree with anything else about what interval a bill may be argued from.

## Excel workbook

The conversion from CSV to Excel includes the addition of new fields:

- `adj_conn_end`, is computed as: `Conn_DateTime_End + TIME_GRID_STEP` (currently 60 seconds). It is the session's **exclusive** end: a session starting at exactly this time does not overlap this one.
- `adj_conn_duration`, is computed as: `adj_conn_end - Conn_DateTime_Start`.
- `conn_start_utc`, `conn_end_utc`, and `adj_conn_end_utc`, with UTC values corresponding to the corresponding local time fields.
- `avg_kw` in kW, is computed as: `Energy_Use / (Active_Charge_Time * 24)`.
- `anomalies`, containing a comma-separated list of `AnomalyKind` variant names, is added as the last column.

None of the data in the Excel workbook (or the source CSV) should be modified by the user, as any changes would impact and possibly invalidate the estimates.

## Estimation logic

### Estimation algorithm overview

Given a time interval of interest **`I`** as described above, the estimation of EV peak power demand during the interval proceeds as follows:

- From the Evolute monthly session report, identify all charging sessions that intersect the interval of interest `I`.
- Partition `I` into 15-minute segments. If `I` is 1-hour long, there will be four segments. If `I` is 15-minutes long, there will only be one segment.
  - The reported peak is therefore **always a 15-minute average**, whatever length of interval was asked for: an hour is reported as the highest of its four segments, never as an average over the whole hour. This is the basis the demand charge is billed on, and it is why the estimates name the segment they came from.
- For each segment:
  - Identify the charging sessions that intersect the segment.
  - For each session:
    - Compute the average power drawn by the session by dividing its energy consumed by the charge time in hours to obtain `avg_kw`.
    - Compute the overlap ratio `overlap_ratio` of the session over the segment's duration.
    - `avg_kw * overlap_ratio` is the session's contribution to the segment's aggregate kW and `overlap_ratio` is session's contribution to the segment's aggregate session count.

  - Compute the segment's aggregate kW `agg_kw` and `agg_count` by summing the above-described per-session contributions over all sessions.

  - From these two key values, compute the following ones:

    - **`energy_based_kw`**: `agg_kw`.

    - **`energy_based_kva`**: `agg_kw` divided by a power factor that reflects the combination of typical EV chargers and the Evolute infrastructure (~0.98). *(Approximate. The software does not divide by a power factor at all — kVA is a quadrature sum, and ~0.98 is a good figure only near full occupancy. See [kW and kVA calculations](#kw-and-kva-calculations).)*

    - **`count_based_kw`**: `agg_count` multiplied by the average per-EV kW rating of the Evolute infrastructure (~6.7 kW). *(Approximate. The per-EV figure is an average, not a constant; it falls as the site fills. See [kW and kVA calculations](#kw-and-kva-calculations).)*

    - **`count_based_kva`**: `count_based_kw` divided by a power factor that reflects the combination of typical EV chargers and the Evolute infrastructure (~0.98). *(Approximate, for the same reason as `energy_based_kva`.)*


- Identify the one or two *maximal* segments, i.e., segments that have the highest:

  - **`energy_based_kw`**: `agg_kw`.

  - **`count_based_kw`**: `agg_count` multiplied by the average per-EV kW rating of the Evolute infrastructure (~6.7 kW). *(Approximate; see [kW and kVA calculations](#kw-and-kva-calculations).)*
- The identified maximal segments are typically one and the same, but may be distinct in some situations.
- Report on the maximal segment(s).

- The software detects data anomalies in the reported session data. Anomalies associated with every session that **intersects `I`** are reported alongside the estimates, as well as anomalies that caused sessions to be excluded from the analysis. Other sessions elsewhere in the workbook are not included in the report.
  - The two listings are scoped differently. The Anomalies table holds sessions reaching `I` and nothing else. The Excluded sessions table covers the whole workbook, so it carries an `In interval` column saying whether each record *appears* to fall in `I` — see [Other](#other).

### Sessions and segments

Sessions, segments, and intervals of interest are all **half-open**: each includes its left end-point and excludes its right one. Consecutive segments therefore meet at a single instant belonging to the later one, so no instant falls in two segments, and *abutting* stays distinguishable from *overlapping* — a distinction the estimates count on. See [Boundaries and the time grid](#boundaries-and-the-time-grid).

`TIME_GRID_STEP` — written **`R`** below, currently 60 seconds — is exactly the resolution at which the session report states session **start and end times**. It is not the resolution of everything in the report: `Conn_Duration` and `Active_Charge_Time` are stated more finely, and several of the Technical Notes depend on that difference.

A time stated to the minute is the true time truncated down to the minute, so a session reported to end at `16:34` truly ended somewhere in `[16:34:00, 16:35:00)`. The software therefore records an adjusted end, **`adj_conn_end`**, one `R` past the reported end — the exclusive bound that contains the true end wherever in that minute it fell. That the report truncates rather than rounds is an assumption; see [Assumptions](#assumptions).

What truncation leaves behind is a residual doubt the estimates have to answer for. Where one session is reported to end in the same minute another is reported to start, the two may have genuinely overlapped for part of that minute, or may merely have abutted; the reported times cannot say which. Similarly, the same margin of uncertainty exists in the overlap of a session with the interval of interest or a segment.

#### Brackets

The software accounts for the above margin of uncertainty by providing values in *brackets*: the minimum value in the bracket and the maximum value in the bracket.

### Interval of interest with no EVs charging

In such cases, the EV charging infrastructure still impacts the overall building's peak kW and kVA, but the impact is small (currently ~ 0.35 kW and ~1.54 kVA for the transformer), and the software reports these values.

## Technical Notes

### Time zone

Moved to [`docs/time/README.md`](../time/README.md). The zone, the DST fold and the inference that
resolves it are used by both modules, so they are documented with the shared `time` module rather
than here.

### Boundaries and the time grid

Half-open is what makes segments properly cover all of the interval of interest without overlaps between them: consecutive segments meet at a single instant that belongs to the later one, so no instant falls in two segments. Closed intervals (i.e., the end is included) cannot do this — adjacent segments would either share an instant, and so disagree about which sessions were active at it, or leave a one-tick gap. It is also what makes *abutting* distinguishable from *overlapping*, which is significant for the estimates.

The padding is a full `R` rather than one tick less for the same reason. A session reported to end at `16:34` truly ended somewhere in `[16:34:00, 16:35:00)`, so `16:35:00` — exclusive — is the bound that contains it wherever it fell.

**The time grid** is a consequence the session boundary resolution being `R`. Reported start and end times lie on the `R` grid; `adj_conn_end` adds exactly one `R`, so it lies on it too. `R` must divide 15 minutes without leaving a remainder. Otherwise, 15-minute segments can't properly partition the interval of interest.

### kW and kVA calculations

The two formulas above — a per-EV kW rating and a division by a power factor — are a fair
description of the *shape* of the estimates, and a defensible approximation of their values. They
are not what the software computes. Both figures come out of a small electrical model of the site,
described in [Power Factor and kVA Allocation — Level 2 EV Chargers on a 75 kVA, 600–208 V Transformer](ev-charger-power-factor-and-kva-allocation.md), and implemented in `src/session/site_model.rs`. It is worth knowing where the model and the shorthand part company.

**The per-EV kW figure is an average, not a constant.** A charging station is current-limited rather than
power-limited: the pilot signal caps it at 32 A, so it draws about 6.59 kW whatever else is
happening. What the site draws on top of that is not proportional to the vehicle count. The
transformer's core loss and magnetizing current are a fixed standing block, present whenever it is
energised, and its copper loss rises with the *square* of loading.

Divide the site total by the number of vehicles and those two effects pull opposite ways: the fixed
block is diluted as vehicles are added, while the copper loss grows faster than the count does. The
per-EV share therefore falls, flattens and edges back up — about 6.95 kW at one vehicle, 6.73 at
three, a shallow minimum of 6.72 around five or six, and 6.75 at all ten. The `~6.7 kW` in the
algorithm description is good to within about 1% across the whole range, and exact to two decimals
near five vehicles, which is where this site's peaks have tended to sit. It is worth knowing that
the *lowest* per-EV figure is the one in the middle, not the one at full occupancy.

**kVA is a quadrature sum, not `kW ÷ PF`.** Real power, displacement reactive power and distortion
reactive power are mutually orthogonal, so they combine as the square root of the sum of their
squares rather than by division. Dividing kW by a power factor would imply that current is free to
grow as the power factor degrades, which is exactly what the pilot signal prevents. The `~0.98` is
a good approximation near full occupancy and a poor one at low counts, for the same reason the
per-EV kW figure moves: the transformer's fixed reactive block is diluted as vehicles are added.
At one vehicle the site power factor is about 0.94; by five it is 0.98, and it plateaus a little
above that. With no vehicle charging at all it is far lower still, because the standing block is
then the whole of the load.

**Past ten vehicles the model adds panels rather than overloading the transformer.** The site as
built holds ten stalls, and the electrical model describes that site: one panel on one transformer.
Segment counts are not bounded by it, though — a future site with more stalls would produce larger
ones — so the estimates read a count above ten as more panels of the same kind, and the site total
becomes proportional to the count at the rate a full panel sets. The alternative, feeding the
larger count into the one transformer, would compound the square-law copper loss and reactance
terms described above and give a figure for an installation nobody would build. The two rules meet
exactly at ten, so an estimate does not jump as a count crosses it, and below ten nothing changes.
This affects the segment estimates only; the site-load table still runs 0 to 10 and is untouched.

**Where the model is written down.** The above-mentioned [electrotechnical document](ev-charger-power-factor-and-kva-allocation.md) derives
every constant and every formula, and tabulates the result for each vehicle count from 0 to 10;
`cargo run --example site_load_report` prints that same table from the code, and
`tests/fixtures/sessions/site_load.report.txt` pins it. `docs/Evolute-Simultaneous_Charging.pdf` is
Evolute's own description of how the installation behaves when several vehicles charge at once.

### Assumptions

- **Session end times are truncated, not rounded.** `adj_conn_end = Conn_DateTime_End + R` is the exclusive bound of the window the true end lies in only because the reported end is the true end rounded *down* to `R`. Under rounding to nearest, or under a convention where the reported end is the first instant the vehicle was no longer drawing power, the correct padding would differ — in the latter case it would be zero.
- **Breaker ratings are uniform across panels.** `count_based_kw` and `count_based_kva` are an aggregate session count multiplied by a single rating, so an installation mixing breakers of different ratings would skew both. Panels enter the estimates in one other place only — the count at which the site total switches from the one-panel model to proportional scaling, described above — and that too assumes every panel is like the first. Which panel a session ran on is never used: the session report carries no panel ID, and none is needed.
  - A session whose own average power exceeds that rating contradicts the assumption directly, and is flagged `ExcessiveAvgKw`. It is not excluded — the figure says something is wrong with `Energy_Use` or `Active_Charge_Time`, not which — but it is worth knowing about, because a segment whose aggregate average power exceeds its member count times the rating would put `energy_based_kw` *above* `count_based_kw` and invert the typical order of these two values. A segment can only invert if one of its sessions draws more than the rating, and every such member is flagged.

### Other

- Every session in the report is written to the workbook, anomalous ones included: the sheet is a faithful rendering of the session report, and which sessions take part in an estimate is decided on the reading side.
- Each session is checked for internal consistency, and the test is *derived* rather than chosen. `docs/session/time-reporting-uncertainty.md` carries the derivation; its **Result** section states the three checks together, and `duration_is_consistent` in `src/session/common.rs` is the one place they appear in code. Any failure raises the anomaly:

  ```
  1.  Conn_start <= Conn_end
  2.  Conn_start + Conn_Duration  <  Conn_end + R + 1s
  3.  Conn_end - R                <  Conn_start + Conn_Duration
  ```

  Every bound is strict, because checks 2 and 3 are the condition for two half-open windows to *meet* rather than an interval anyone chose. That makes this the one band in the design that is open rather than half-open — an instance of the convention rather than an exception to it. The band is not slack: it is precisely what truncation to whole minutes accounts for, and the sample data reaches to within 3 seconds of its lower edge. It is also asymmetric, one second wider on the late side, because the reported end is truncated *and* of unknown last-second convention — the same second that appears in `adj_conn_end`.
- Check 1 is not implied by the other two, and is the reason they are three rather than two. A record whose end precedes its start by a single minute, carrying a duration near zero, satisfies checks 2 and 3; letting it through gives the estimating logic a span that ends before it begins.
- A session failing any of the three is flagged `InconsistentDuration` and excluded from the estimates. Every direction is a fault: if a record's own fields disagree by more than the reporting can explain, neither its duration nor the span the estimating logic would place it on can be relied on.
- These are the *only* sessions excluded from the estimates. Nothing else removes a session.
- Excluded sessions get a section of their own in the report, listing **every** one in the workbook rather than only those near the interval of interest, with an `In interval` column saying whether each *appears* to fall in that interval. Appears only: a record whose own fields contradict each other cannot be trusted to say where it belongs, so filtering on that judgement could hide exactly the session a reader most needs to see. Such a record may even report an end before its start, and the column answers for it.
- `Charge_Session_ID` is **not unique**. Evolute's June 2026 report carries `S37487` on two sessions a week apart, within the one file, and reports for adjacent months overlap so a session near the boundary appears in both.
  - Two records stating the same session identically — same adjusted start and end, charge time and energy — are one session, and only one copy is kept. This is what lets a billing period be estimated from the two monthly reports spanning it without every shared session counting twice.
  - Two records sharing an id but differing in any of those fields are two sessions. Both are kept and both take part in every estimate, and each is flagged `DuplicateId`.
  - The flag cannot distinguish a reused id from two reports disagreeing about one session; from the merge the two look identical. Neither is treated as fatal, because refusing the first would make June 2026 unestimatable, and the judgement belongs to a reader who can go back to the source rows.
- Sessions with zero `Energy_Use` and non-zero `Active_Charge_Time` do not contribute to `energy_based_kw` and `energy_based_kva` but they do contribute to `count_based_kw` and `count_based_kva`.
- A session with zero `Active_Charge_Time` delivered energy in no time at all, so its average power is unbounded or undefined.
  - The Excel `avg_kw` cell shows `#DIV/0!` so the fault is visible in the sheet. Both readers — `csv_sessions` from the CSV and `xlsx_to_sessions` from a workbook — return the session as a *spike*, held apart from the normal sessions fed to the peak logic.
  - Spikes are worth reviewing individually for their effect on the building's demand charge.
  - The power estimating logic treats spikes as follows:
    - If `Energy_Use == 0`, set `avg_kw` to 0. These sessions do not contribute to `energy_based_kw` and `energy_based_kva` but they do contribute to `count_based_kw` and `count_based_kva`.
    - Otherwise, set `avg_kw` to the constant `BREAKER_RATING_KW`. These sessions contribute to all four estimate types.
