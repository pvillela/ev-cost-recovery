# Generates THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md and stamps it with two hashes: the inputs it was made from, and
# the text it wrote.
#
# `build.rs` recomputes both on release builds and refuses to build if either does not match, so a
# release binary cannot embed notices that have fallen behind the dependency graph, nor notices
# somebody has edited. The file is gitignored: a committed copy would go stale the moment a
# dependency moved, and a stale notice is worse than none -- it names crates the binary no longer
# carries and omits ones it does.
#
# Installs cargo-about if it is missing, so this script is the only thing anyone needs to know
# about. Runs from anywhere: it moves to the repository root itself.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/gen-notices.sh
set -euo pipefail

# Every path below, and cargo-about's own manifest lookup, is relative to the repository root.
# Going there rather than demanding the caller already be there removes the commonest way to run
# this wrongly, and makes the output land in one predictable place whatever the caller's cwd.

# `Cargo.lock` fixes every crate version, and crates.io versions are immutable, so these three
# files determine the output completely. Keep this list, and its order, identical to `build.rs`.
