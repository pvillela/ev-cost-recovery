//! Cuts a small, still-valid ESPI feed out of a large one, to make a test fixture.
//!
//! Fixtures are trimmed from real data rather than synthesised, so what the tests exercise is the
//! feed a utility actually produces. This is committed so that a fixture can be regenerated and
//! its provenance checked, rather than being a binary nobody can account for.
//!
//! Trimming works at whole-`<entry>` granularity: the `LocalTimeParameters`, `UsagePoint`,
//! `ReadingType` and `MeterReading` entries are always kept, so the link chain the parser follows
//! stays intact, and `IntervalBlock` entries are kept when the day they cover falls in range. Each
//! block is a whole day anchored to 05:00 UTC, which is local midnight in winter but 01:00 in
//! summer, so a range is not expected to line up with a billing period's local-midnight edges --
//! give it a day of slack either side and let the partial periods stand. They exercise the
//! incomplete-period highlight.

const USAGE: &str = "\
gb_trim_fixture -- cut a small ESPI feed out of a large one.

Keeps every entry needed to make the feed parse, plus the IntervalBlocks covering days from FROM to
TO inclusive, both read as Toronto local dates. Writes to stdout.

Give a day of slack either side of the billing period you want covered: blocks are anchored to
05:00 UTC, so in summer they start at 01:00 local and will not line up with a period boundary.

Usage:
    cargo run --example gb_trim_fixture -- <XML> <FROM> <TO> > out.XML

Example:
    cargo run --example gb_trim_fixture -- data/green_button/TH_Electric_Usage_23-11-2024_to_24-06-2026.XML 2025-07-23 2025-08-24
