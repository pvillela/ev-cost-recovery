const USAGE: &str = "\
Estimates the EV charging contribution to peak power demand over an interval of interest.

Usage: ev_peak_cli <SESSION_REPORT.xlsx> <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [EST|EDT]> [15m|1h]

The interval start is given in local time (ET), because that is what Toronto Hydro's metering data
is stated in. Length defaults to 1h when the start is on the hour and 15m otherwise.

  ev_peak_cli June.xlsx \"2026-06-01 16:00\" 1h
  ev_peak_cli June.xlsx \"2026-06-01 16:45\"
  ev_peak_cli Nov.xlsx  \"2026-11-01 01:30 EDT\" 15m

On the night DST ends, one hour of wall time occurs twice; add EST or EDT to say which is meant.
The designator is accepted at any time and checked against the date, so a wrong one is an error
rather than a figure for the wrong hour. A time in the DST gap is rejected outright: it never
occurred, so there is nothing to choose between.

The interval is constrained: it must start at HH:00, HH:15, HH:30 or HH:45, and may run for one
hour only from HH:00. A demand charge is billed on a 15-minute average, so an interval off those
boundaries could not be compared to a bill. One breaking the rules is rejected rather than
estimated.

The report is written to stdout as markdown that also reads as plain text.";
