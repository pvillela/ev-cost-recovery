gb_peak_values -- billing-period peak values from a Green Button export.

Reads a Toronto Hydro Green Button (ESPI) XML export and writes an Excel workbook beside it with
two sheets. Peak_values carries one row per billing period: the energy used, the highest demand in
kW and kVA over the whole period and within the 7-7 demand window, when each of those occurred, and
the Time-of-Use period it fell in. Interval_values carries every hour of the export.

A billing period runs from the start of day {start_day} of one month to the end of day {BILL_END_DAY} of the next, in
Eastern Standard Time, and is labelled by that closing date. Standard time all year: the boundary
does not move when the clocks do, so from March to November it falls at 01:00 by the wall clock.

The output file is named after the input, with an .xlsx extension, and is written to the same
directory. An existing file is never overwritten: move or delete it first. That is deliberate --
figures in these workbooks get reconciled against real invoices, and a silent overwrite is how that
work gets lost.

An interval count that is not what a complete billing period should hold is highlighted in light
red, as is any cell reporting an anomaly.

Usage:
    gb_peak_values <XML>
    gb_peak_values --help

Example:
    gb_peak_values data/TH_Electric_Usage_23-11-2024_to_24-06-2026.XML
    -> data/TH_Electric_Usage_23-11-2024_to_24-06-2026.xlsx

The feed must carry hourly readings for all three of kWh, kW and kVA. Anything else is an error
naming what was missing, rather than a workbook with a hole in it.
