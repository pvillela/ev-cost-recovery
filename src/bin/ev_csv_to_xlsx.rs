const USAGE: &str = "\
Converts a charging session report from CSV to .xlsx.

Usage: ev_csv_to_xlsx <SESSION_REPORT.csv>...

Each workbook is written beside its input with the extension replaced. A file already standing
where the workbook would go is refused, not overwritten: move or delete it first.

Rows needing a judgement
call — an ambiguous DST fold, a wall time in the DST gap, a session with no charge time, one whose
reported duration runs past its reported end — are reported on stderr and recorded in the
workbook's Anomalies column; they do not stop the conversion. Row numbers are rows of the CSV, so a
record duplicated to resolve a DST fold is reported twice against the one row it came from, once
per copy; the -EDT/-EST suffix on the session id tells the two apart.

A .session.convert.log is written beside the workbook. It lists the same findings, or says there
were none.";
