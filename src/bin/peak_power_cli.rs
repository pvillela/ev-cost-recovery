const USAGE: &str = "\
peak_power_cli -- peak power estimates for one billing period.

Reports the intervals of interest that maximize kW and kVA in the billing period, one report for
each. A billing period is named by the date it closes on.

Two session reports are asked for because a billing period straddles two calendar months, and an
Evolute session report covers one. Give the one covering the start of the period first and the one
covering its end second.

The reports are written to stdout as markdown that also reads as plain text.

Usage:
    peak_power_cli <YYYY-MM-DD> <GREEN_BUTTON.XML> <SESSIONS_1.csv> <SESSIONS_2.csv>
    peak_power_cli --help

Example:
    peak_power_cli 2026-06-23 data/TH_Electric_Usage.XML data/May.csv data/June.csv
