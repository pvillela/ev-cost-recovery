const USAGE: &str = "\
cost_recovery_surplus_cli -- EV cost recovery against EV cost, for one billing period.

Reports what the EV cost-recovery rates recover, what the chargers' share of the bill cost, and the
difference. A positive surplus means the rates covered that share; a negative one means they fell
short.

The three parts are printed in full beneath the summary, so every figure in the subtraction can be
checked against the report it came from.

No closing date is asked for: the bill states which period it covers, and everything else is
fetched for that period.

A billing period straddles two calendar months, and an Evolute session report covers one month, so
two are asked for. Give the one covering the start of the period first and the one covering its end
second.

A rate schedule is written EFFECTIVE_DATE:ON_PEAK,MID_PEAK,OFF_PEAK. Give one schedule for a period
the rates held through, and two when they changed during it -- the first being the rates in effect
on the period's first day, whose effective date may be well before the period, and the second the
rates it changed to. A change takes effect at local midnight starting its date.

Only the delivery and energy sides of the bill are counted as EV cost.

The report is written to stdout as markdown that also reads as plain text.
