hydro_bill_dump -- what a Toronto Hydro bill PDF parses to.

Reads a Toronto Hydro bill PDF and writes the resulting HydroBill to stdout in Rust's debug form,
one field per line. Nothing is written to disk.

A figure that appears more than once on the bill is added up before it is printed. That happens
when a billing period straddles the Summer/Winter boundary, which gives it two Time-of-Use blocks,
and when it straddles a rate change, which prints every delivery and regulatory line twice.

A bill whose layout this does not recognise is an error naming the line it stopped on, rather than
a structure with a zero where a charge should be. --lines is how to see what the layout actually
is: it prints the text of the PDF as positioned lines, page by page, and parses nothing.

Usage:
    hydro_bill_dump <PDF>
    hydro_bill_dump --lines <PDF>
    hydro_bill_dump --help

Example:
    hydro_bill_dump data/hydro_bills/TH_5728140000_2025_07_28.pdf
