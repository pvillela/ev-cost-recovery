const USAGE: &str = "\
cost_recovery_cli -- EV cost recovery for one billing period.

Applies the EV cost-recovery rates given to the energy the chargers drew in each time-of-use band,
and reports what that recovers. A billing period is named by the date it closes on.

The rates are yours rather than Toronto Hydro's, so no bill is read and no tax is added: the report
is the rate times the kilowatt-hours it was charged on.

A billing period straddles two calendar months, so two session reports are asked for and an Evolute
session report covers one month. Give the one covering the start of the period first and the one
covering its end second.

A rate schedule is written EFFECTIVE_DATE:ON_PEAK,MID_PEAK,OFF_PEAK. Give one schedule for a period
the rates held through, and two when they changed during it -- the first being the rates in effect
on the period's first day, whose effective date may be well before the period, and the second the
rates it changed to. A change takes effect at local midnight starting its date.

The report is written to stdout as markdown that also reads as plain text.

Usage:
    cost_recovery_cli <YYYY-MM-DD> <RATES> [RATES] <SESSIONS_1.csv> <SESSIONS_2.csv>
    cost_recovery_cli --help
