/// # How the figure is arrived at
///
/// The EV kilowatt-hours in each of the three time-of-use bands are taken as [`fn@energy`] takes
/// them, raised by the bill's loss factor, and priced at the bill's own rate for that band — the
/// band's cost line divided by the consumption it was charged on. "Blended" because a period
/// straddling a rate change carries each band's line twice, at the old rate and the new, and
/// [`HydroBill`] holds the two added together; the quotient is what was actually charged per kWh,
/// whatever the schedule said.
///
/// The loss factor is applied because the bill's own rates are per *adjusted* kilowatt-hour: its
/// three time-of-use consumption lines sum to `adjusted_kwh_used`, not to `kwh_used`. Pricing an
/// unadjusted EV figure at such a rate would understate the share by the loss factor.
///
/// HST and the Ontario Electricity Rebate are then applied in the bill's own proportions, taken
/// against `total_electricity_charges` rather than from a statutory rate, so a bill that rounds or
/// prorates either of them carries that through to the EV share.
///
/// Only the three time-of-use lines are attributed. The three demand-priced delivery lines are
/// [`peak_power_cost`](super::peak_power::peak_power_cost)'s, since they turn on which interval the
/// site peaked in rather than on how much was drawn. The customer charge and the standard supply
/// administration charge are fixed. The wholesale market service charge is levied per kilowatt-hour
/// and so is attributable in principle, but is not among the figures returned.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `bill` - the Toronto Hydro bill for the period, which supplies the period, the loss factor and
///   every rate used. Nothing is assumed about the tariff.
/// - `sessions` - every session from every report covering the period, as [`fn@energy`] takes them,
///   with the same obligation to supply all of them and the same treatment of duplicates and of
///   records that contradict themselves.
