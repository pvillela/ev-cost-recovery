/// | Bill line | Levied on | Interval of interest |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | Distribution Charges | `Adj. kVA` | the hour the site's kVA peaked in |
/// | Transmission Connection Charge | `Adj. kW` | the hour its kW peaked in |
/// | Transmission Network Charge | `Adj. Peak kW 7-7` | the hour its kW peaked in within 07:00-19:00 |
///
/// For each, the EV share of that same interval is estimated the way [`fn@peak_power`] estimates
/// it, prorated to a 30-day month as the bill prorates its own figure, and priced at the bill's
/// blended rate — the line divided by the adjusted demand it was charged on. "Blended" because a
/// period straddling a rate change carries every delivery line twice, at the old rate and the new,
/// and [`HydroBill`] holds the two added together; the quotient is what was actually charged per
/// kW, whatever the schedule said.
///
/// HST and the Ontario Electricity Rebate are then applied in the bill's own proportions, taken
/// against `total_electricity_charges` rather than from a statutory rate, so a bill that rounds or
/// prorates either of them carries that through to the EV share.
///
/// Everything else on the bill is left out. Consumption is billed by the kilowatt-hour and the
/// customer charge is fixed, so neither turns on which interval the site peaked in and neither
/// belongs in a figure derived from one.
///
/// Note what falls out of pricing at the blended rate: since the rate is a quotient against the
/// *adjusted* demand, and the EV figure is adjusted by the same day count, the proration cancels.
/// Each line comes to the bill's own line times the EV share of the demand it was charged on.
/// [`DeliveryCost::days_adj_factor`] is reported all the same — it is what makes the two adjusted
/// figures comparable, and a reader checking the arithmetic against the bill needs to see it.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `bill` - the Toronto Hydro bill for the period, which supplies every rate and every day count

/// - `sessions` - every session from every report covering the period, as [`fn@peak_power`] takes
