//! Fixtures shared by the unit tests of more than one module in this directory.
//!
//! One billing period, one bill for it, one meter export and one set of sessions, so that a figure
//! computed by two operations can be compared between them. A second definition of any of these
//! would be a second place for the two to drift apart, which is exactly what
//! [`cost_recovery_surplus`](super::recovery::cost_recovery_surplus) exists to subtract.
//!
//! What stays with a module's own tests is anything that reads a result rather than builds an
//! input. Those are about one operation and belong beside it.
