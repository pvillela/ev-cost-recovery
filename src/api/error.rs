//! The one error type a front-end has to render.
//!
//! Each API function returns the narrowest type that describes what it can actually fail at, and
//! each of those lives with the function that raises it: a pure function cannot fail to read a
//! file, and its signature says so. That is the right shape for a caller who wants to act on the
//! failure, and the wrong shape for one who only wants to print it.
//!
//! [`ApiError`] is what those collapse into — one variant per stage of an API call, rather than one
//! per failure mode of every function. It sits in its own module because it depends on both halves
//! of the API and neither depends on it; putting it beside the narrow types would have pointed that
//! arrow the wrong way.

// Written into the message, unlike `ReadError::path`. The readers name their own file and prefixing
// theirs produced `data/x.XML: data/x.XML: ...`; these errors name none, so without the prefix a
