//! What a front-end asks the library, stated in the terms a front-end has.
//!
//! The rest of the crate is organised by the source of data it reads. A caller checking an invoice
//! has none of those in hand — it has a billing period, a meter export and the charging network's
//! monthly reports — so this module is where those become the calls the other modules understand.
//!
//! # How it is arranged
//!
//! [`pure`] computes and [`io`] reads. Every `io` function turns paths into values and delegates,
//! so that the reasoning a figure rests on can be exercised without a filesystem, and so that one
//! file answers what the library touches on disk.
//!
//! Types live with the function that produces them, errors included:
//! [`PowerEstimates`](pure::peak_power::PowerEstimates) and
//! [`PeakPowerError`](pure::peak_power::PeakPowerError) with `peak_power`,
//! [`SessionReportCoverage`](pure::coverage::SessionReportCoverage) and
//! [`CoverageError`](pure::coverage::CoverageError) with `coverage`,
//! [`CostRecovery`](pure::recovery::CostRecovery),
//! [`CostRecoverySurplus`](pure::recovery::CostRecoverySurplus) and their two errors with
//! `recovery`,
//! [`ReadError`](io::ReadError) with `io`.
//!
//! [`ApiError`](error::ApiError) is the exception, and has a module of its own: it is the union every call collapses
//! into for a front-end that would rather render one type, so it depends on both halves while
//! neither depends on it.
//!
//! # Importing from here
//!
//! The unit of import is the operation, not the type: `use ev_cost_recovery::io::peak_power;` gives
//! both the function and the module, so the call and the types its signature names come from one
//! import.
//!
//! The rule each module follows is that it re-exports every type a caller must be able to *name* in
//! order to use its public items — for a function, its parameters and return type; for an enum, its
//! variant payloads, since matching past the first level forces the caller to write them. Calling a
//! function therefore never requires knowing which module it delegates to.
//!
//! Field types are excluded, because reading or destructuring a field never requires naming it. Probing *into* a returned type may well lead elsewhere in the
//! crate — the two halves of [`PowerEstimates`](pure::peak_power::PowerEstimates) are
//! [`session::IntervalEstimates`](crate::session::IntervalEstimates), and reading about them
//! means going there. Re-exporting transitively would put the whole crate in every module.
//!
//! There is deliberately no roster of every type here, and no module of shared ones. Either would
//! gather a result and an error per operation into one flat namespace — the arrangement being
//! avoided, spelled `pub use` instead of `pub struct`. [`error`] is the one module named for
//! something other than an operation, because the union belongs to all of them.
