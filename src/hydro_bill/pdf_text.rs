//! Text out of a PDF, with the position of every run on the page.
//!
//! A bill is a table without table markup: what makes `1,761.07` the distribution charge is that
//! it sits on the same baseline as the words `Distribution Charges`, and what separates a charge
//! from the marketing column beside it is that the two are at different horizontal positions.
//! Plain-text extraction throws both facts away, so this keeps them: each run of text is reported
//! at the point where it starts, and runs sharing a baseline are grouped into a [`Line`].
//!
//! What this deliberately does not do is lay out glyphs. Only the starting point of each shown
//! string is computed, never the width it occupies, so no font metrics are needed. That is enough
//! to read a form whose fields are separately positioned, which is what these bills are.
//!
//! `lopdf` supplies the objects, the streams and the decompression; the text is decoded here.
//! Its own `get_font_encoding` rejects the CMaps in these bills -- its grammar wants whitespace
//! where Toronto Hydro's generator writes `/CMapName/Adobe-Identity-UCS` and `>>def` -- and,
//! worse, reports the rejection as a successful fall back to StandardEncoding. That turns every
//! glyph into the wrong character while still returning `Ok`, which is exactly the failure a bill
//! parser must not have. `ToUnicode` below reads the same CMaps and returns an error when it
//! cannot.
