//! Reading a Toronto Hydro bill PDF into a [`HydroBill`].
//!
//! The bill is a form, not a table: every figure is found by the words next to it. Two habits of
//! the generator shape the parsing.
//!
//! First, a label and its value are separate runs of text sharing a baseline, so a value is read
//! as "the run to the right of these words" rather than by any column index. Second, the same
//! label can appear more than once on one bill, and the values must then be added. That happens
//! for two independent reasons: a billing period that straddles the Summer/Winter boundary
//! carries a Time-of-Use block for each season, and a period that straddles a rate change carries
//! every delivery and regulatory line twice, once at the old rate and once at the new. Toronto
//! Hydro prints "Seeing double? You're not being charged twice" beside the second set.
//!
//! Which page a section lands on moves with the length of the charges, so the whole document is
//! read as one sequence of lines rather than page by page.
//!
//! [`super::pdf_text`] supplies the positioned text and knows nothing of bills; everything that
//! knows what a Toronto Hydro bill looks like is here.
