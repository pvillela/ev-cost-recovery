//! Toronto Hydro bills: the charges themselves, as distinct from the metered consumption that
//! `green_button` reads and the charging sessions that `session` reads.
//!
//! The two older modules answer *how much* — kilowatt-hours, kilowatts, kilovolt-amperes, and
//! which quarter-hour the site peaked in. Neither answers *what it cost*, and the project exists
//! to work out how much of a bill EV charging is responsible for. That last step needs the bill:
//! the rate schedule, the delivery and regulatory lines, the loss factor, and the way a demand
//! charge is levied on a monthly peak rather than on consumption. [`HydroBill`] is that bill, and
//! [`hydro_bill_from_pdf`] reads one straight out of the PDF Toronto Hydro issues.
//!
//! Behind those two names the source is a stack, each file knowing less than the one above it:
//! `bill.rs` is the figures alone, `bill_pdf.rs` is everything that knows what a Toronto Hydro bill
//! looks like, and [`pdf_text`] is positioned text out of any PDF at all. Only the last is a module
//! of its own here, because reading a PDF is a job in its own right and its `Line` and `Fragment`
//! read better with it named.
//!
//! Singular because the unit of work is one bill for one billing period. A run reconciles a series
//! of them, but nothing here holds a series: every figure in [`HydroBill`] belongs to the period
//! that bill covers, and `bill.rs` says which one that is.
//!
//! What a billing period *is*, `billing_period.rs` defines: [`BILL_END_DAY`], [`BillingPeriod`] and
//! [`billing_period_dates`]. It is here because the period is the bill's, and the rest of the crate
//! divides its data that way only because the bill does.
