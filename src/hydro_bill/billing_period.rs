//! What a Toronto Hydro billing period is: which day it closes on, which instants it spans, and
//! which calendar dates those instants fall on.
//!
//! A billing period runs from the start of the day after `bill_end_day` of one month to the end of
//! `bill_end_day` of the next, in **standard time**, and is labelled by that closing date. The June
//! 2026 invoice states its period as `MAY 23 2026 TO JUN 23 2026` over `31` days, which is the same
//! span read from the meter-reading instants rather than the calendar days.
//!
//! # What the bill's two dates mean
//!
//! They are stated in EST, and they name the meter readings that bound the period rather than the
//! days it covers. Read as days, `FROM` is exclusive and `TO` is inclusive: the period covers all
//! of June 23rd and none of May 23rd. No clock makes it 23rd to 23rd -- on an EST clock the covered
//! days run 24th to 23rd, and on a summer EDT clock the span runs from part of the 24th to part of
//! the following 24th.
//!
//! Inferred rather than stated. The bill says only `MAY 23 2026 TO JUN 23 2026` and `31`; counting
//! both dates would give 32 and counting neither 30, so exactly one endpoint is included, and the
//! reconciliation of 19 invoices with Green Button data is what says which.
//!
//! Standard time, not prevailing local time: the boundary is at 00:00 EST all year and does not
//! move when the clocks do. That is what the invoices say. Cutting at prevailing local midnight
//! instead reproduces 6 of 19 invoices; cutting on a fixed EST clock reproduces all 19 to the
//! milli-kWh, and matches the `Number of Days` each bill states in every period rather than in 16
//! of them. `docs/hydro_bill/archive/dst-energy-anomaly-pre-fix.md` is the derivation.
//!
//! Only the boundary is on standard time. Time-of-Use periods, the 07:00-19:00 demand window and
//! the holiday calendar stay on prevailing local time, because those are stated in the clock a
//! customer reads and the bills' on-peak and mid-peak energy confirms it.
//!
//! # Why this is in `hydro_bill`
//!
//! A billing period is a fact about the bill. Everything else divided by one — the meter readings
//! `green_button` groups, the session reports `session` reads, the estimates `api` produces — is
//! cut this way because the bill cuts it this way, so the rule belongs where the bill is and the
//! rest of the crate reads it from here.
//!
//! It was in three places before it was here: [`BILL_END_DAY`] in `hydro_bill`, [`BillingPeriod`]
//! in `green_button`, and [`billing_period_dates`] in `api::pure`. Each move outward was a small
//! step, and together they meant that answering "what is a billing period" needed three files in
//! three modules.
//!
//! What is *not* here is anything that reads a period rather than defining one. `green_button`
//! knows how many meter intervals one should hold, because that is a question about the feed;
//! `api::pure::coverage` knows which monthly reports cover one, because that is a question about
//! file names.
//!
//! # Choosing the closing day
//!
//! Which day the bill closes on belongs to the bill rather than to the meter data, so
//! [`BillingPeriod`] does not decide it: both entry points take it as `bill_end_day` and the caller
//! supplies [`BILL_END_DAY`]. That keeps the rule for cutting readings in one place while leaving
//! the fact it is cut on in the other.
