//! The `.xlsx` rendering of a session report, written and read back.
//!
//! Both directions live here; neither parses a CSV. [`session_csv_to_xlsx`] takes the rows
//! [`super::csv`] has already resolved and lays them out as cells, formats, formulas and comments.
//!
//! The two directions are not symmetric in what they serve. Writing is API — the Convert tab and
//! `api::io::session_csv_to_xlsx` — while *reading a workbook back* supports only `ev_peak_gui`
//! and `ev_peak_cli`, and lives in the `historic` submodule behind the feature of that name.
//! Nothing the API does goes through it; the API reaches sessions from the CSV, through
//! [`csv_sessions`](super::csv::csv_sessions).
//!
//! The `anomalies` column is the channel between the two directions: a judgement call made when
//! the CSV was parsed is written there and read back by `historic::xlsx_to_sessions`, and it is
//! what removes a session from the estimates. See [`AnomalyKind`].

///
/// The parse is `csv::csv_session_rows`; nothing about the session report is interpreted here. The
/// domain rules — the UTC conversion and its DST policy, the definitions of `adj_conn_end` and
/// `adj_conn_duration`, and the treatment of zero-`Energy_Use` sessions — are specified in
/// `docs/time/README.md` under "Time zone" and in `docs/session/README.md` under "Excel workbook"
/// and "Other". They are shared with the peak power contribution logic and are not restated here.
///
/// What this function adds on top of those rules:
///
/// - Column order is given by the private `COLUMNS` table: the session report's own columns first,
///   in the order it states them, then everything this software derives. See
///   `docs/session/README.md`, "Excel workbook".
/// - Timestamp columns are Excel date/time numbers formatted `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss ddd`, left-
///   justified; duration columns are Excel durations formatted `[h]:mm:ss`, which does not wrap
///   past 24 hours, and are centered.
/// - `adj_conn_duration` and `avg_kw` are live formulas. `adj_conn_duration` subtracts the two
///   *UTC* columns, so it is true elapsed time even across a DST fold; `avg_kw` is
///   `=Energy_Use/(Active_Charge_Time*24)`, in kW, displayed to 3 decimal
///   places, matching `Energy_Use`. The formula is written on every row, so a session with
///   zero `Active_Charge_Time` shows `#DIV/0!` rather than an empty cell:
///   it delivered energy in no time at all, and the sheet says so. `Total_Fee` is displayed to
///   2 decimal places.
/// - The last column, `anomalies`, carries the [`AnomalyKind`]s found for the row as a
///   comma-separated list of variant names. `historic::xlsx_to_sessions` reads it back, so it is
///   the channel by which a judgement call made during the parse reaches the peak power
///   contribution logic.
/// - The remaining columns are copied over with an explicit per-column type, so values that merely
///   look numeric — postal codes, station ids — keep their text form.
/// - The sheet is named by the private `sheet_name`.
///
/// Every session in the report is written to the workbook, anomalous ones included: the sheet is a
/// faithful rendering of the session report, and which sessions take part in an estimate is decided
/// on the reading side. A caller that wants the sessions and not the sheet can skip the workbook
/// entirely and call the private `csv::csv_sessions`, which runs the same parse.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `Err` only for conditions that invalidate the whole file: it cannot be read, a required
/// header is missing, a timestamp or duration does not parse, or the workbook cannot be written.
/// Per-row judgement calls do not abort the conversion; they are collected in
/// [`SessionWriteReport::anomalies`].
