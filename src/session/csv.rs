//! Reading a session report CSV, as Evolute exports it.
//!
//! This is where the session report becomes [`Session`]s: the CSV is parsed, each record's local
//! wall times are resolved to UTC, the DST fold is settled or the record duplicated, and every
//! judgement call is recorded as an [`AnomalyKind`]. Nothing here knows about workbooks.
//!
//! Two ways out, sharing all of that:
//!
//! - [`session_list`] buckets the sessions for the peak power contribution logic, straight from
//!   the CSV. No workbook is involved.
//! - `session_rows` hands the rows over in report order, with the pass-through CSV fields still
//!   reachable, which is what [`super::excel::session_csv_to_xlsx`] needs to render them.
//!
//! Bucketing is lossy — it sorts sessions into three vectors and drops report order, the link back
//! to the CSV record, and the reported wall times — so the writer cannot be built on
//! [`session_list`]. Both sit on `session_rows` instead.
//!
//! The module is named for what it reads, so the `csv` crate is written `::csv` throughout to keep
//! the two apart.
