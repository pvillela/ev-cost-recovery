//! What makes an interval of interest a *legal* one, in one place for every front-end.
//!
//! The library core stays permissive on purpose:
//! [`estimates_from_sessions`](super::estimates_from_sessions) is happy with any interval, and
//! exploratory callers and tests rely on that. What must not happen is a *bill* being argued from
//! an off-spec window, so every front-end that lets someone choose an interval comes through
//! [`checked_interval`]. See docs/session/README.md, "Interval of interest boundaries".
//!
//! The command line and the GUI ask the same questions in different orders — the one parses text
//! and reports what is wrong with it, the other offers only choices that are right — so what is
//! shared here is the rules themselves, not their presentation.
//!
//! # Why this is behind `historic`
//!
//! Those two front-ends are the only callers. The API is handed an interval and does not choose
//! one, and the desktop app derives its window from a billing period rather than offering it as a
//! setting. So the whole question this module answers arises only where someone picks the window
//! by hand, which is `ev_peak_cli` and `ev_peak_gui`. See `docs/historic-feature.md`.
