//! How sessions land on the quarter-hour segments that tile an interval of interest.
//!
//! A unit test rather than an integration test. The tiling is
//! [`estimates_from_sessions`](super::estimates_from_sessions) and the `segments_for_ioi` it calls;
//! the API reaches both through `api::peak_power`, which also wants a meter export and a bill, and
//! neither of those bears on where a session's span falls. So this reads the CSV and calls the
//! tiling directly.
//!
//! The fixture is `Session_Report_Diagram.csv`, seven sessions over 16:00–17:00 chosen to exercise
//! every geometry the tiling has to get right at once, and `docs/session/segment-tiling.md` walks
//! through the same example in prose:
//!
//! ```text
//!            16:00      16:15      16:30      16:45      17:00
//!              |          |          |          |          |
//!   A   15:54 =|==========|==========|==========|==========|===== 17:04
//!   B     15:59|=====|16:16                                        overruns the left edge
//!   C          |  16:08 =====|16:43                                nested, spans two segments
//!   E          |         16:20 ==|16:35                            staggered start with D
//!   D          |          16:24 =|16:35                            ends the same minute as E
//!   F          |            16:34 =====|16:43                      starts the minute D and E end
//!   G          |                       16:48 ==|16:56              alone in the last segment
//! ```
//!
//! Spans are `[conn_start, adj_conn_end)`, so each right edge is the reported end plus one
//! `TIME_GRID_STEP`. That is why `F` overlaps `D` and `E` rather than merely abutting them: all
//! three are reported to the minute, and the minute they share may hold any of them.
//!
//! No assertion here names an electrical constant. The numbers this file does state are clock
//! times and session counts, which are properties of the fixture rather than of the site model.
