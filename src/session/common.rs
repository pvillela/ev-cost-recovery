/// Resolution this software works session boundaries to.
///
/// **Ours, not Evolute's.** Evolute currently reports `Conn_DateTime_Start` and `Conn_DateTime_End`
/// truncated to whole minutes, and this is set to match; but the two are different quantities, and
/// the document that derives everything built on this calls them `EV_STEP` and `OUR_STEP` for that
/// reason. See `docs/session/time-reporting-uncertainty.md`.
///
/// The distinction decides what to do if Evolute ever reports seconds. **Do not follow them down
/// to 1 second while reports of both resolutions are still processed together.** This constant is
/// global; `EV_STEP` belongs to a report. A calculation spanning a minute-resolution report and a
/// second-resolution one has no single right value for it, so it has to sit at the coarsest
/// resolution still in scope. Finer reporting is a reason to narrow the allowances below, not to
/// move the grid.
///
/// The constraint lifts once every report in scope reports seconds. 1 second is a legal grid — it
/// divides [`SEGMENT_DURATION`], and [`LEGAL_START_MINUTES`](super::LEGAL_START_MINUTES) still
/// lands on it — so from then on the change is available, though it moves every figure in the
/// golden files.
///
/// Every allowance the software makes for the reporting's truncation is this one value:
///
/// - Added to the reported session end to give `adj_conn_end`, the session's exclusive end.
/// - The width of the window a sound record's `Conn_start + Conn_Duration` must land in — one step
///   early, one step and a second late. See `duration_is_consistent`.
///
/// `Conn_Duration` and `Active_Charge_Time` are *not* truncated; they carry seconds. That asymmetry
/// is what makes the DST fold inference possible, and it is why the window above has a width at all.

/// would tile past the interval's end and count sessions falling outside it, and rounding down
/// would leave part of it unestimated. Neither error would show in any figure the report prints,
