//! What a session report's *file name* says, and whether a set of them reaches from one date to
//! another.
//!
//! The name is what a span of dates is checked against, rather than the records inside. A report
//! legitimately holds no session on a quiet day, so its contents cannot tell "nobody charged" apart
//! from "wrong file", and it is the second of those that would quietly halve an estimate.
//!
//! Nothing here opens anything. A `&Path` is read as a string, which is why this sits beside
//! the private `session::csv` rather than inside it: that module turns the file into
//! [`Session`](super::Session)s, and this one never gets that far.
//!
//! What billing period the dates read here have to cover is not a question about a file name, so it
//! is not answered here.
//! [`api::pure::check_reports_cover_period`](crate::api::pure::check_reports_cover_period) joins
//! the two.
