//! How many meter readings a billing period is supposed to contain.
//!
//! What a billing period *is* lives in [`hydro_bill::billing_period`](crate::hydro_bill), because
//! it is a fact about the bill. This is the one thing about a period that is a fact about the feed
//! instead, and it is here for that reason: the count is in [`METER_INTERVAL`]s, which is
//! `green_button`'s unit and nothing the bill knows about.
//!
//! An inherent method rather than a free function, because `period.expected_intervals()` is how it
//! reads at the two call sites and the split is an artefact of where the constant lives.
