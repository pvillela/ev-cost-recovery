//! Checks the computation against a real Toronto Hydro invoice.
//!
//! This is the only test whose expected values come from outside the software. Everything else
//! pins behaviour against itself or against a workbook this project's own predecessor produced; if
//! a rule here were wrong in a self-consistent way, only this test would notice.
//!
//! The invoice covers `MAY 23 2026 TO JUN 23 2026`, which is the period the `billed_period`
//! fixture carries in full.
//!
//! A unit test rather than an integration test, and in a file of its own rather than inside
//! another module's test block. It needs [`period_values`](super::period_values), which is
//! `pub(crate)`: producing every period's figures as values is not something the API offers, and
//! widening the API so that a test can reach it would be the wrong way round. Its fixtures come
//! from `tests/fixtures/green_button/` through [`golden::fixture`](crate::golden::fixture) — the
//! same files an integration test would have opened.
