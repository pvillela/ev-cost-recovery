//! Excel serial-date arithmetic, shared by both sheet writers.
//!
//! Excel has no concept of a time zone. A serial is a count of days since day zero, and a local
//! column and a UTC column differ only in which instant was converted; they are told apart by
//! their number format, not by anything stored in the cell.
//!
//! The names say which input a function takes, because that is where the two modules previously
//! disagreed: both had a function called `excel_serial`, one taking a [`Timestamp`] and one taking
//! a [`civil::DateTime`], with different meanings. Keeping either name would have silently changed
//! behaviour on one side, so neither survives.
//!
//! All of these are infallible. The fallible forms could only fail on a civil date-time that UTC
//! cannot represent, and UTC has no gaps or folds, so the error was unreachable.
