//! The Ontario holiday calendar, as the Ontario Energy Board defines it for Time-of-Use pricing.
//!
//! This is deliberately **not** the Employment Standards Act list, and deliberately not a holiday
//! crate. The two differ in ways that move money:
//!
//! * The **August Civic Holiday** is on the OEB's published TOU schedule and is *not* an ESA
//!   public holiday. Leaving it out would reclassify a summer weekday's 07:00-19:00 block as
//!   on/mid-peak and can shift a monthly peak.
//! * The ESA's substitute-day entitlement is negotiated per employee within a three- or
//!   twelve-month window. It is not a calendar rule and cannot be computed.
//! * The `holidays` Python package this replaces never shifts Canada Day, even when July 1 falls
//!   on a Sunday, and couples its `PUBLIC`/`OPTIONAL` categories such that dropping the Civic
//!   Holiday also drops correct Boxing Day substitutes.
//!
//! The OEB's substitution rule, quoted verbatim from
//! <https://www.oeb.ca/consumer-information-and-protection/electricity-rates/holiday-schedule-time-use-and-ultra-low>:
//!
//! > If a holiday falls on a weekend, the next weekday (that is not also a holiday) will have the
//! > holiday prices in effect all day.
//!
//! Note that this is **additive**: the weekend day is already off-peak because it is a weekend, and
//! the substitute weekday joins it. The holiday is not moved.
//!
//! Every date here is a rule, so the calendar needs no annual maintenance. It does assume the
//! current schedule applies throughout: see `docs/maintenance-manual.md`, "The Ontario holiday
//! calendar is not the ESA list", for what would force a re-check.
