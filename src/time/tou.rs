//! Ontario Time-of-Use price periods.
//!
//! The Ontario Energy Board publishes these as two weekday schedules that swap on-peak and
//! mid-peak between seasons, plus a blanket rule for weekends and holidays. Quoted verbatim from
//! <https://www.oeb.ca/consumer-information-and-protection/electricity-rates>:
//!
//! > **Winter (November 1 – April 30)** — Off-Peak: Weekdays 7 p.m. – 7 a.m. Weekends and holidays
//! > all day. Mid-Peak: Weekdays 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. On-Peak: Weekdays 7 a.m. – 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. –
//! > 7 p.m.
//! >
//! > **Summer (May 1 – October 31)** — Off-Peak: Weekdays 7 p.m. – 7 a.m. Weekends and holidays all
//! > day. Mid-Peak: Weekdays 7 a.m. – 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. – 7 p.m. On-Peak: Weekdays 11 a.m. –
//! > 5 p.m.
//!
//! Off-peak is season-invariant; only the labels on the midday block and the two shoulder blocks
//! trade places. Summer peaks midday, winter peaks morning and evening.
//!
//! Two things below are **implementation choices, not OEB policy**, because the OEB is silent on
//! both. The season changeover is taken to happen at local midnight on May 1 and November 1 — the
//! OEB states the seasons only as calendar dates. And the daylight-saving transitions get no
//! special handling: they occur at 02:00 local, every boundary here is at 07:00, 11:00, 17:00 or
//! 19:00, and 02:00 is inside the off-peak block in both seasons, so the spring gap and the autumn
//! fold cannot land on a boundary. That is a consequence of the two rule sets, not something the
//! OEB has ruled on.
//!
//! Note also what these periods are *not*. Toronto Hydro's `Peak kW 7-7` demand window is a
//! distribution-charge measurement window, not a pricing period; it happens to be exactly the
//! complement of the weekday off-peak block, which is why [`is_off_peak`] can serve both. See
//! `docs/maintenance-manual.md`, "What would force a re-check of the TOU rules", for what would
//! drive them apart.
