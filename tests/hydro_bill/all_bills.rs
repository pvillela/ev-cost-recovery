//! Slow-tier check against every real bill in `data/hydro_bills`.

//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test integration -- hydro_bill::all_bills --ignored --nocapture

//! Parsing without error is the weaker half of what this checks. The stronger half is that the

//! dropped because a rate change printed it twice, still parses -- it just gives a total that no
//! longer equals its parts.
