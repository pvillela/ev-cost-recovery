//! Requires feature "historic".
//!
//! Golden-file tests for the rendered [`ev_peak_contrib::IntervalEstimates`].
//!
//! Each case pairs an input CSV in `tests/fixtures/` with the report it must produce, checked
//! byte for byte. Layout is the thing under test, and layout is only judged by looking at it — so
//! the expectation is a file you can read rather than a list of assertions about substrings. A
//! change in wrapping, padding or column order shows up as a diff in the golden file, which is
//! exactly where it should be visible during review.
//!
//! The cases between them cover every shape the renderer has: a report whose four segments differ
//! from each other, so the Estimates section has a maximal quarter to name and the Segments table
//! has something to show; and one carrying session anomalies and an excluded-sessions section.
//! Both are reached through the real path, from a CSV.
//!
//! The site-load table is pinned here too, by the same variable, so one command regenerates every
//! golden file the crate has.
//!
//! These files are the one deliberate exception to the rule that no test may depend on the value of
//! a freely-declared constant. They pin *rendering* — column widths, decimal places, wrapping — and
//! no relational reformulation preserves any of that. Changing an electrical constant is therefore
//! expected to fail exactly these tests and no others; see `docs/maintenance-manual.md`,
//! "Which constants are free, and which are derived".
//!
//! To regenerate after an intended change, having read the diff:
//!
//! ```sh
//! UPDATE_REPORT_GOLDEN=1 cargo test --test integration -- session::report_rendering
//! ```
