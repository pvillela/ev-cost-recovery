//! The `InconsistentDuration` band, exercised end to end through the public API.
//!
//! Unit tests in `session::excel` already pin the predicate. This pins the *consequence*: which
//! sessions reach an estimate and which are put aside. Nothing did that before, which is how commit
//! `1d99e29` moved the band by a whole `TIME_GRID_STEP` — excluding 116 of the 238 sessions in the
//! real June report — with the whole suite green. See `docs/archive/merger-review-findings.md`, finding 1.
//!
//! # The arithmetic every record here is one second away from
//!
//! With a reported start of `16:10` and end of `16:40`, `Δ = 30:00`, the three checks of
//! `duration_is_consistent` reduce to a closed range of sound durations:
//!
//! ```text
//! check 2:  16:10 + d  <  16:40 + 60s + 1s   =>  d <= 0:31:00
//! check 3:  16:40 - 60s  <  16:10 + d        =>  d >= 0:29:01
//! ```
//!
//! So `[0:29:01, 0:31:00]` is sound and everything outside it is not. Each record below sits on one
//! of those two edges or one second past it. Getting a bound wrong by a single second moves a real
//! record between the two groups, so a second is the right resolution to test at.
//!
//! `INVERT1` tests check 1 on its own, and is the case with no unit-test equivalent reachable from
//! a CSV: a one-minute inversion is the smallest the reporting can express, since both reported
//! times are whole minutes, and that forces the duration to zero. It therefore also carries
//! `ZeroActiveChargeTime` — the two travel together by arithmetic, not coincidence.
